    "DebateAgent_prompt": "A patient presents with a series of symptoms including {phenotype_list_placeholder}. Genetic testing has identified mutations in the following Gene Mutation List: {gene_list_placeholder}. The patient's detected mutations that are included in the ClinVar database are listed in the following *high confident mutated genes*: {ClinVar_pathogenic_genes}. Explore the potential impact of each mutation and infer the ordered sequence of the gene mutation pathogenicity responsible for the patient's condition. \n    \n    **Remember you still need to write your full explanation with the template of Analysis 1 and Analysis 2 for more details to become a diagnostic report. However, you cannot just repeat the Analysis 1 and Alysis 2, you must integrate them and the answer must include all following aspects, separately. Answer no less than 500 words.**\n    Your analysis should thoroughly explore the following criteria when inferring the new ordered sequence according to the two answers:\n    1. Consistency and correctness of Evidence: List and examine the consistency of evidence for each gene provided in both results and its coherence with existing knowledge when inferring the new sequence of gene pathogenicity. The answer still must contain threes separated parts just like in Analysis 1 and 2: \"Role\", \"Impact\" and \"Ranking Reason\". \n    2. Severity Assessment: List the evaluation of the severity of each phenotype, considering both the immediate health impacts and long-term consequences. Determine which phenotypes are primary, directly resulting from genetic mutations.\n    3. During the gene ranking process, if a gene impacts patient's phenotype and belongs to the given *high confident mutated genes*, it is prioritized over the other genes that are only related to the patient's phenotype.\n    4. Clarity of Causation: When inferring the ordered sequence of gene mutation impacts on disease, it's crucial to delineate clear causative relationships.\n    5. Polygenic Nature of Disease: Considering how these genes interact with each other and collectively contribute to the disease phenotype.\n    6. Prioritization and Sequence Order: Inferring a new sequence order of gene mutation pathogenicity responsible for the patient's condition from the above information, formatted as a JSON-format list:\n    { \n    \"Genetic_mutation_order\": [\"GENE1\", \"GENE2\", \"GENE3\", ... (ensure all genes from the initial list are included) ...] \n    }\n    7. Explain why each gene in the \"Genetic_mutation_order\" is ranked in its current position compared to other genes and why not in higher. Explain each gene separately including the three parts: role, impact, and ranking reason.\n\nAnalysis 1:\n    {KnowledgeAgent_analysis_placeholder}\n\nAnalysis 2:\n    {DataAgent_analysis_placeholder}"
