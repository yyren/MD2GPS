    "DataAgent_prompt": "Before delving into the specific case at hand, consider the following example as a answer-template for your analysis. This example demonstrates how to dissect the potential impact of genetic mutations on a patient's complex presentation and how to methodically identify the primary pathogenic mutation based on a structured evaluation of each gene's role and its impact on the patient's condition.\n    [Example]:\n    [Question]:\n    Imagine you are a scientist with expertise in both biology and medicine, facing a complex patient case.

Genetic testing has identified mutations in the Gene Mutation List: HYDIN, RTEL1, MYOC, RDH12, COL2A1, PPP2R2B, CBL, TBL1XR1, AUTS2, NALCN, SCN3A, and KCNQ2. Your mission is to determine the order in which these gene mutations contribute to the disease's pathogenicity. This involves dissecting the molecular pathways each gene mutation affects, leading to the observed clinical signs.\n    I consider the ranking of gene pathogenicity to the patient is:  HYDIN, RTEL1, MYOC, RDH12, COL2A1, PPP2R2B, CBL, TBL1XR1, AUTS2, NALCN, SCN3A, and KCNQ2\n    \n    Your analysis should thoroughly explore:\n    1.

This case requires integrating knowledge of genetics, molecular biology, and pathology to provide a comprehensive understanding.\n    \n    1. Gene-Specific Contributions and Ranking Justification\n    HYDIN:\n    Role: HYDIN is primarily associated with the development and function of cilia. Mutations can lead to ciliary dyskinesia, affecting respiratory tract cilia and potentially brain ventricle ependymal cilia.\n    Impact: While not directly explaining the full range of symptoms, HYDIN mutations could contribute to developmental delays through impacts on brain fluid dynamics and perhaps contribute indirectly to other phenotypes through generalized developmental disruptions.\n    Ranking Reason: Placed first due to its foundational role in developmental processes and potential indirect effects on multiple systems, although its direct link to the most severe symptoms is less clear.\n    \n    RTEL1:\n    Role: Involved in telomere maintenance and DNA repair. Mutations can lead to telomere-related disorders, affecting cell longevity and increasing susceptibility to damage.\n    Impact: This could contribute to developmental delays and motor deterioration due to premature cell aging and dysfunction, especially in highly proliferative tissues.\n    Ranking Reason: Its critical role in genomic stability places it high, as it can indirectly influence numerous developmental processes, although its direct connection to specific symptoms like cardiac or facial abnormalities is less explicit.\n    \n    MYOC:\n    Role: Associated with ocular pressure regulation. MYOC mutations are commonly linked to glaucoma.\n    Impact: Directly explains the abnormal eye morphology and potentially contributes to developmental delays through associated visual impairment.\n    Ranking Reason: Given the specificity to eye morphology, it's ranked lower than genes with broader systemic impacts but is still prioritized due to the direct linkage to observed phenotypes.\n    \n    RDH12:\n    Role: This gene is crucial in the visual cycle, affecting retinal development and function.\n    Impact: Mutations can lead to severe visual impairment, contributing to developmental delays and possibly impacting motor skills due to reliance on visual cues for development.\n    Ranking Reason: Similar to MYOC, its impact is significant but organ-specific, explaining its placement after genes with more systemic influences.\n    \n    COL2A1:\n    Role: Essential for collagen synthesis and skeletal system development. Mutations often lead to skeletal dysplasia and abnormalities in cartilage and bone development.\n    Impact: Could explain facial abnormalities, dolichocephaly, and possibly contribute to motor deterioration through skeletal and joint issues.\n    Ranking Reason: This gene's mutations have a broad impact on physical development, justifying its position ahead of more organ-specific genes.\n    \n    PPP2R2B:\n    Role: Involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth and division.\n    Impact: Mutations could contribute to developmental delays and neurological symptoms due to disruptions in signaling pathways important for neural development.\n    Ranking Reason: Its broad role in cellular signaling underpins many developmental processes, placing it amidst genes with systemic and developmental impacts.\n    \n    CBL:\n    Role: Functions in regulating cell signaling pathways for cell growth and differentiation. Mutations are linked to various disorders, including developmental delays and abnormalities in facial features.\n    Impact: Can contribute to the wide range of developmental and morphological abnormalities seen in the patient.\n    Ranking Reason: Its systemic impact on cell signaling justifies a middle ranking, as it underlies multiple phenotypic expressions without being the primary contributor to the most severe symptoms.\n    \n    TBL1XR1:\n    Role: Plays a role in transcriptional regulation and Wnt signaling, impacting cellular proliferation and differentiation.\n    Impact: Mutations might contribute to global developmental delay and specific morphological features due to disruptions in critical developmental pathways.\n    Ranking Reason: Its importance in developmental signaling pathways accounts for its positioning, with a significant but not singular role in the patient's phenotype.\n    \n    AUTS2:\n    Role: Associated with neural development and connectivity. Mutations can lead to autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, and developmental delays.\n    Impact: Directly linked to neurological and developmental symptoms, including speech and language delays.\n    Ranking Reason: While crucial for neurological development, it's ranked lower due to the more focused impact on neural development over other systemic symptoms.\n    \n    NALCN:\n    Role: Involved in neuronal excitability and signaling. Mutations can lead to congenital contractures, muscle weakness, and developmental delays.\n    Impact: Can explain muscle weakness, upper limb hypertonia, and contribute to developmental delays through neuromuscular impairments.\n    Ranking Reason: Its specific role in neuromuscular signaling explains its position, emphasizing direct neurological and muscular symptoms over broader developmental or systemic issues.\n    \n    SCN3A:\n    Role: Codes for a voltage-gated sodium channel involved in the generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons.\n    Impact: Mutations in SCN3A can lead to epilepsy, motor dysfunction, and developmental delays, given its critical role in neuronal function.\n    Ranking Reason: While crucial for understanding motor and some neurological symptoms, it is ranked lower due to the presence of genes with broader developmental impacts. However, its direct link to neurological symptoms justifies its precedence over some other genes.\n    \n    KCNQ2:\n    Role: Important for neuronal excitability and associated with a form of neonatal epilepsy.\n    Impact: Directly influences neurological development, which could contribute to developmental delays and perhaps motor deterioration.\n    Ranking Reason: Positioned last not because it's unimportant, but because its primary association with a specific neurological condition places it after genes with wider ranging developmental impacts. However, it is critical for understanding specific aspects of the neurological phenotype.\n    \n    2. Ranking Rationale Overview\n    The chosen ranking reflects a balance between the breadth of each gene's impact on development and the specificity of its contribution to the patient's symptoms. Genes impacting a wide range of developmental processes and systems (e.g., HYDIN, RTEL1) are prioritized due to their potential to underlie multiple observed phenotypes, even if their effects are more generalized rather than symptom-specific. Genes with critical roles in specific organs or systems (e.g., MYOC, RDH12) follow, recognizing their direct contribution to significant aspects of the patient's condition. This ranking prioritizes a holistic view of pathogenicity, considering both widespread developmental influences and organ-specific impacts.\n    \n    3. Final Ordered Gene List\n    Based on the analysis and rationale provided, the final ordered gene list reflecting pathogenicity in relation to the patient's condition is:\n    { \n    \"Genetic_mutation_order\": [HYDIN, RTEL1, MYOC, RDH12, COL2A1, PPP2R2B, CBL, TBL1XR1, AUTS2, NALCN, SCN3A, KCNQ2] \n    }\n    \n    This list attempts to mirror the complexity of the patient's symptoms through an integrated understanding of genetic contributions, spanning broad developmental processes to specific organ system functions.\n        \n    \n    Now, applying the same depth of analysis and structured approach as illustrated in the example, examine the following patient's condition. The patient presents with a range of symptoms including {phenotype_list_placeholder}. Genetic testing has identified mutations in the Gene Mutation List: {gene_list_placeholder}. Your mission is to determine the order in which these gene mutations contribute to the disease's pathogenicity. This involves dissecting the molecular pathways each gene mutation affects, leading to the observed clinical signs.\n    I consider the ranking of gene pathogenicity to the patient is {proposed_mutation_order_placeholder}.\n    \n    Your analysis should thoroughly explore:\n    1. List the specific contributions of each gene mutation to the patient's condition and evaluate their roles and impacts using current molecular biology knowledge. Explain why, according to the order provided by me, it is ranked in its current position compared to other genes. Give the explanation including the three parts: role, impact, and ranking reason.\n    2. Explain why this ranking of gene pathogenicity was chosen over others.\n    3. You must summary according to the ranking of gene pathogenicity provided by me and give a final ordered gene mutation list following a JSON-format list:\n    { \n    \"Genetic_mutation_order\": [\"GENE1\", \"GENE2\", \"GENE3\", ... (ensure all genes from the initial list are included) ...] \n    }"
